SIDEBURN
========

Sideburn is a next-generation jQuery slideshow widget.

The options are read from data attributes on the container that will be
transformed rather than passed in to the function. This makes it easier to
specify the transitions and other settings as data at runtime or by a CMS at
"edit-time" rather than as options in code when the widget gets instantiated.

The intention is to allow a wide range of transition and layout options and
also to allow adding new ones as plugins.

It is currently in-progress.
